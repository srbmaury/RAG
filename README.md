# Atlas — Document intelligence

Atlas is a private, workspace-based research app. Upload documents, connect read-only data sources, ask questions across selected sources, and inspect citations that link back to the evidence.

The app uses a Next.js/TypeScript frontend and a FastAPI backend. Local development uses SQLite; Docker Compose runs PostgreSQL with pgvector. You can generate answers with Ollama on your machine, OpenAI, or use source excerpts without an AI provider.

## Architecture and request flows

The diagrams below describe the code in this repository, rather than a proposed architecture. GitHub renders them directly with Mermaid.

### System architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  User["Browser user"] --> UI["Next.js frontend<br/>frontend/app and components"]
  UI --> Proxy["Next.js /api proxy"]
  Proxy --> API["FastAPI<br/>backend/app/main.py"]
  API --> DB[("SQLite in local dev<br/>PostgreSQL / pgvector in Compose")]
  API --> Files[("Original uploaded files")]
  API --> Conn["On-demand provider adapters<br/>Google · Microsoft · GitHub · Notion · Slack · Jira · Linear"]
  Conn --> Providers["External provider APIs"]
  API --> Retrieval["Keyword / vector retrieval<br/>backend/app/retrieval.py"]
  Retrieval --> DB
  API --> Synthesis["Grounded answer generation<br/>ai.py / connected_synthesis.py"]
  Synthesis --> Model["Optional Ollama or OpenAI"]
  API --> Queue["Document status / lease<br/>stored in database"]
  Queue --> Worker["Ingestion worker<br/>backend/app/worker.py"]
  Worker --> Parser["Parsing · OCR · chunking<br/>backend/app/ingest.py"]
  Parser --> Files
  Parser --> Model
  Worker --> DB
```

In local development the API and worker can run in the same environment; Compose runs separate API and worker services. The worker claims document records from the database rather than consuming messages from a separate queue broker. Connector records are fetched on demand, not automatically ingested into the document library.

### Code flow: upload and index a document

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor User
  participant Web as Next.js UI
  participant API as FastAPI
  participant DB as Database
  participant Store as Original file storage
  participant Worker as Ingestion worker
  participant Extract as Parser / OCR / chunker
  User->>Web: Choose one or more files
  Web->>API: POST /workspaces/{workspaceId}/documents
  Note over Web,API: Large files use staged /uploads endpoints
  API->>Store: Store original file
  API->>DB: Create queued document record
  API-->>Web: Return document status
  loop Until eligible work is available
    Worker->>DB: Claim queued / expired-lease document
  end
  Worker->>Extract: Parse text, OCR if configured, split into passages
  opt Embeddings configured
    Extract->>Extract: Generate passage embeddings
  end
  Worker->>DB: Persist passages and ready / failed status
  Web->>API: Refresh document list / status
  API-->>Web: Updated indexing state
```

The worker renews leases during processing and can retry transient failures. Search uses only documents marked ready.

### Code flow: ask a question and inspect evidence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor User
  participant Web as Ask Atlas
  participant API as FastAPI
  participant Search as Retrieval and source adapters
  participant DB as Indexed document passages
  participant Provider as Connected provider APIs
  participant AI as Ollama / OpenAI (optional)
  User->>Web: Ask question and choose source scope
  Web->>API: POST /workspaces/{workspaceId}/connected-chat/stream
  API-->>Web: Search progress event
  API->>Search: Collect scoped evidence
  opt Documents selected
    Search->>DB: Keyword + optional vector retrieval
    DB-->>Search: Ranked passages
  end
  opt External sources selected
    Search->>Provider: Read permitted records on demand
    Provider-->>Search: Matching records and excerpts
  end
  Search-->>API: Numbered evidence
  alt AI provider configured
    API->>AI: Question + bounded source excerpts
    AI-->>API: Grounded answer with source references
    API->>API: Validate reference IDs
    API-->>Web: Answer / completion events
  else No AI provider
    API-->>Web: Retrieved excerpts or explicit configuration error
  end
  Web-->>User: Answer with cited sources
  User->>Web: Select citation
  Web-->>User: Show passage / open original provider URL
```

For documents-only requests, the server may use the document answer-generation path rather than cross-source synthesis. Source IDs are checked, but a valid ID is **not proof** that every claim is supported by its citation. If the model cannot produce a valid answer, clients should show an explicit failure instead of inventing conclusions.

### Where to follow the code

| Workflow | Entry point | Key modules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend workspace | `frontend/app/page.tsx` | `components/AtlasWorkspace.tsx`, `components/chat/`, `components/documents/` |
| Upload and background indexing | `backend/app/main.py` document/upload routes | `worker.py`, `ingest.py`, `db.py` |
| Document retrieval | `backend/app/main.py` chat routes | `retrieval.py`, `ai.py` |
| Cross-source answers | `backend/app/main.py` connected-chat routes | `external_sources.py`, `gmail.py`, `drive.py`, `connected_synthesis.py` |
| Citation display | `frontend/components/chat/ResearchAnswer.tsx` | `frontend/lib/evidence.ts` |



GitHub code-search questions can also ask Atlas to **trace a code flow** (for example, “trace the document upload flow”). Atlas performs a bounded first-pass code search, extracts up to three function/class symbols from returned snippets, and searches for references to those symbols. Results are labeled by a conservative path-based layer hint such as Frontend / UI, API / routing, Backend / service, or Database / persistence. This is a discovery aid, not a complete call graph: GitHub search indexing, snippets, dynamic dispatch, generated code, and cross-repository boundaries can leave gaps. Open the linked files and verify each hop before treating the trace as complete.

## Get started locally

### Requirements

- macOS or Linux (the staged-upload implementation uses filesystem locks)
- Python 3.9 or later
- Node.js 20.9 or later and npm
- Tesseract OCR for scanned PDFs (optional; Docker installs it for you)
- Ollama for local AI (optional), or an OpenAI API key

### Install and start

Run these commands from the repository root:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt
```

Generate an encryption key for connected-source credentials:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

Copy the printed value into `.env` as `GMAIL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...`. This key is required for encrypted connected-source credentials. Keep it private and back it up: Atlas cannot decrypt saved credentials if the key is lost or changed.

Start the API in one terminal:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=backend .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Start the frontend in a second terminal:

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, create an account, and use the default workspace or create another. The API docs are at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>.

For scanned PDFs, install Tesseract locally (`brew install tesseract` on macOS or `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr` on Debian/Ubuntu). To turn OCR off and accept searchable PDFs only, set `OCR_ENABLED=false` in `.env`.

To try document search, upload the examples in `samples/` and ask a question such as “What budgets were proposed?” The sample documents intentionally disagree about dates and budgets.

SQLite data and uploaded files are stored under `data/` by default. The directory is excluded from Git. Back it up if you need to preserve a local workspace.

## Choose how Atlas generates answers

The `.env.example` file defaults to `AI_PROVIDER=openai` with an empty API key. In that configuration, Atlas still searches sources and shows matching excerpts, but does not synthesize answers.

### Local AI with Ollama

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).
2. Download the chat and embedding models:

   ```sh
   ollama pull qwen3:4b
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ```

3. Set these values in `.env`:

   ```dotenv
   AI_PROVIDER=ollama
   OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
   OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL=qwen3:4b
   OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
   ```

4. Restart the API.

Ollama keeps prompts and generated answers on the machine running Ollama. Atlas does not set an output-token cap for local generation; response time depends on your hardware, and the model still has a finite context window. New uploads use local embeddings. To re-embed existing documents, stop the API worker and run from the repository root:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=backend .venv/bin/python evals/reindex_local.py
```

### OpenAI

Set `AI_PROVIDER=openai` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`, then restart the API. Optionally set `CHAT_MODEL` and `EMBED_MODEL`; the defaults are `gpt-4.1-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`.

With OpenAI selected, document passages and selected connected-source excerpts are sent to the configured OpenAI API for embeddings or answer generation. Responses use `store=False`; that does not promise zero provider-side retention. Only send content you are authorized to process with that provider.

### Search without generated answers

Set `AI_PROVIDER=none` and leave `OPENAI_API_KEY` empty. Atlas returns matching source excerpts instead of a synthesized answer.

## Connect data sources

Google Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook and SharePoint OAuth setup is described in [Connected source setup](docs/FIVE_SOURCE_CONNECTORS.md). Their integrations remain read-only, and live consent flows require provider configuration.


Connections are workspace-scoped and retrieved on demand. Connect a provider in **Sources**, then select it above the prompt in **Ask Atlas**. Source data is not automatically copied into the document library. Disconnecting removes Atlas's saved credential; revoke the token or app authorization at the provider as well when appropriate.

Atlas encrypts saved provider credentials with `GMAIL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Do not commit `.env`, share credentials, or paste a bot token where a user token is required.

### Gmail

1. In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create or choose a project, enable the **Gmail API**, configure the OAuth consent screen, and create an OAuth client of type **Web application**.
2. Add this Authorized redirect URI for local development:

   ```text
   http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/callback
   ```

3. Add the client ID and secret to `.env`:

   ```dotenv
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/callback
   ```

4. Make sure `GMAIL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set, restart the API and frontend, then open **Sources → Gmail → Connect Gmail** and authorize read-only access.

Gmail search is opt-in per Ask Atlas question. Email is fetched on demand, not indexed automatically. The connector uses the restricted `gmail.readonly` scope; public deployments may need Google's verification and security assessment. Review Google's current requirements before publishing.

### Google Drive

Use the same Google Cloud project and OAuth Web application as Gmail. Enable the **Google Drive API** and add this additional Authorized redirect URI:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/drive/callback
```

Set the Drive redirect in `.env` and restart:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_DRIVE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/drive/callback
```

Connect from **Sources → Google Drive**. Atlas uses read-only Drive access and reads files on demand. It can extract text from Google Docs, Sheets (CSV), PDF, DOCX, and supported text files. Slides and image-only Drive PDFs are not supported as Drive evidence. Drive access uses the restricted `drive.readonly` scope; review Google's verification and security-assessment requirements before public launch.

### GitHub

Create a fine-grained personal access token scoped to the repositories Atlas should access, with read-only **Metadata**, **Issues**, **Pull requests**, and **Contents** permissions. Contents access is needed for source-code search. Add it under **Sources → GitHub**.

Atlas can search repositories, issues, pull requests, and source-code files. Code searches are scoped to the connected account by default; add an explicit `repo:owner/name` qualifier to narrow a search to one repository. Results and file snippets are limited to repositories and records visible to the token. Atlas never writes to connected repositories.

### Notion

Create an internal integration in [Notion My integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations), copy its secret, and share the pages or parent pages you want Atlas to read with that integration. Add the token under **Sources → Notion**.

Notion integrations only see pages shared with them. Atlas searches accessible page titles and reads page blocks on demand; a valid token does not grant automatic access to every workspace page.

### Slack

Slack message search requires a **user-scoped OAuth token** with the `search:read` user token scope. Bot tokens may authenticate but cannot use message search.

1. Create or open the Atlas app in the [Slack API console](https://api.slack.com/apps).
2. Under **OAuth & Permissions → User Token Scopes**, add `search:read`.
3. Reinstall the app to the intended workspace and authorize the requested access.
4. Copy the **User OAuth Token** (not the Bot User OAuth Token) and add it under **Sources → Slack**.

The user token can search content that the authorizing Slack user can access. Slack may require you to reauthorize Atlas after changing scopes.

## Run with Docker Compose

Docker Compose runs PostgreSQL/pgvector, the API, a separate background worker, and the frontend. From the repository root:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to a strong value in `.env`. Set `GMAIL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` if you will connect sources. Add an AI provider configuration if you want generated answers, and add the Google OAuth values if using Gmail or Drive. Then run:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The database and documents use named volumes. The web port is bound to loopback. Compose runs Ollama on the host by default only if you configure:

```dotenv
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
```

Pull the models on the host before connecting. `host.docker.internal` lets the API container reach Ollama on macOS/Windows; on Linux, configure a host-gateway route or use another reachable Ollama URL.

The default Compose PostgreSQL password is for local development only. Changing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` after PostgreSQL has initialized does not change the existing database user's password; recreate or update the database credentials deliberately. Do not expose this development stack directly to the public internet.

## Troubleshooting

- **Atlas only shows excerpts, not an answer:** Check `AI_PROVIDER`, the API logs, and that Ollama is running or the OpenAI key is valid. Restart the API after changing `.env`.
- **Ollama is unreachable in Docker:** `127.0.0.1` inside a container refers to that container. Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434` on macOS/Windows or a host-reachable address on Linux.
- **A saved connection cannot be decrypted:** `GMAIL_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` changed or is missing. Restore the original key; otherwise reconnect each provider. Back up the key with the database.
- **Google OAuth returns a redirect error:** The callback URL must match the URI registered in Google Cloud exactly, including scheme, host, port, and path.
- **Google OAuth says access is blocked:** In OAuth consent-screen testing mode, add the account as a test user. Check that the required Gmail or Drive API is enabled and review verification status.
- **Slack says token type is not allowed:** Reconnect with the User OAuth Token after adding `search:read` and reinstalling the app.
- **Notion search returns no pages:** Confirm Atlas was shared with the page or a parent page. The token alone cannot see unshared content.
- **Scanned PDF has no text:** Install Tesseract OCR. Set `OCR_ENABLED=false` only when you want to require searchable PDFs.
- **A model change produces poor document search:** Re-embed existing documents after changing embedding providers or models.

## Development and validation

Run backend tests and frontend checks from the repository root:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=backend .venv/bin/pytest backend/tests -q
cd frontend
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The tests use an isolated temporary database and mock provider calls. They do not verify OAuth credentials or live access to Gmail, Drive, GitHub, Notion, or Slack.

Install the development requirements before running style checks. From the repository root,
`make format` applies Ruff import sorting/formatting and Prettier; `make format-check`
checks Python lint/formatting and frontend formatting without changing files.

For browser tests, install Playwright and Chromium:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install --no-save @playwright/test@1.56.1
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test
```

## What Atlas supports

- Workspace accounts, private documents, saved conversations, and source citations.
- PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, CSV, JSON, and HTML ingestion. Individual files can be up to 250 MB; scanned PDF text extraction uses Tesseract OCR.
- Durable document processing with retry and reindex controls.
- Keyword search, optional vector search, and source-grounded answers.
- On-demand Gmail, Drive, GitHub, Notion, and Slack retrieval when each source is connected.

Connected sources use permission checks at the provider and do not sync in the background. AI answers can miss details; review cited passages before relying on them. Atlas validates citation references but does not prove every claim is supported by its citation.

## Security and deployment notes

This project is a development release, not a hardened public service. Before serving other users, add HTTPS and set `COOKIE_SECURE=true`, configure a protected secret store, restrict database/network access, validate backup and restore, and implement rate limits, audit logging, and document parsing isolation. Review provider verification and privacy requirements for the scopes you enable. Do not deploy the sample Compose password or expose the development stack publicly.

Tokens and originals are workspace data. Protect the database, document volume, `.env`, and encryption-key backup as one set. Revoking a token at the provider is separate from disconnecting it in Atlas.

## Organisations and access roles

Open your avatar to visit **Account & settings** (`/settings`). Use **Workspace settings**
for membership, source permissions, ownership, security history, and deletion; use
**Organisations** to manage teams and create organisation workspaces. The workspace
switcher stays focused on switching and creating personal workspaces.
Create an organisation, add existing registered Atlas accounts by email, and create
organisation workspaces from the Organisations section. Add members to each workspace explicitly;
organisation membership alone does not grant access to its content. Personal
workspaces can also grant access directly to registered accounts.

| Scope | Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organisation | Owner | Manage organisation membership; remains the protected owner |
| Organisation | Admin | Manage organisation members and create organisation workspaces |
| Organisation | Member | Belong to the organisation; needs a separate workspace grant |
| Workspace | Manager | Read and ask, manage documents and workspace members, create connections, delete workspace |
| Workspace | Editor | Read and ask, upload/import, reindex, and delete documents |
| Workspace | Viewer | Read documents, download originals, search permitted sources, and ask questions |

Workspace creators remain protected managers. Adding or changing membership uses
**Add or update member** with the registered account's exact email and desired role.
Atlas does not send invitation emails. Organisation deletion, SSO, groups, and
custom roles are not implemented. Owners can use **Transfer ownership** to choose an
existing member and confirm by typing the workspace or organisation name. The previous
workspace owner remains a manager; the previous organisation owner remains an admin.
Transfer a departing member's workspaces before removing them from the organisation.
Documents are preserved; private chats and personal credentials keep their owners.

**Privacy boundaries:** saved conversations belong to their author, including in
shared workspaces. Organisation administrators do not automatically gain workspace
content access. Connector credentials are private to the connecting user by default.
Only their owner, while a workspace manager, can explicitly share, replace, or
remove a connection. Source permissions support private, selected-member, and
all-workspace access. Grant selected members in **Source permissions**, or use the
workspace-wide checkbox to include every current and future member. Managers and
organisation admins cannot bypass source grants. Provider permissions still bound
what the shared credential can retrieve; choose those permissions accordingly. This is not per-file
provider ACL replication. One credential slot per provider/workspace is supported.

Removing a member revokes their workspace access, removes their source grants, and
disconnects their saved credentials so an offboarded account cannot occupy a provider slot.
Revoke provider-side authorisation separately when appropriate.
Unsharing blocks future retrieval, but does not erase excerpts already saved in
other members' private chats. API permissions are checked on the server, including
legacy connector routes and OAuth callbacks; slow chat results recheck access before
releasing answer text.

**Security history** lists membership, ownership, connection creation/removal, and
source-sharing changes. Managers can read workspace history; organisation owners and
admins can read organisation-wide access metadata (including workspace events),
without receiving workspace content access. Ownership, membership, source-grant and
credential changes serialize on their parent resource to avoid conflicting updates.
Events are committed atomically with
successful access changes, are paginated, and cannot be modified or deleted through
the API. No credentials, prompts, or source excerpts are recorded. Events start at
this upgrade; older changes are not reconstructed.

Every scoped route declares its required role through `workspace_permission` or
`organisation_permission`; role selection does not depend on URL matching. The route
coverage regression test catches newly added workspace routes missing a declaration.

Migrations `0007` and `0008` run at startup. Migration `0008` adds source grants and
security history without broadening existing sharing or rewriting credentials.
Migration `0007` preserves existing workspaces as personal,
assigns existing chats and connections to their workspace owner, and keeps all
connections private. Back up the database before upgrading. Downgrade is deliberately
blocked because dropping access metadata could expose shared workspace data; restore
a pre-upgrade backup if a rollback is required.

 
## Security and production readiness

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for implemented safeguards and the explicit
production-hardening checklist. Local unit tests do not verify real provider OAuth
configuration or deployed infrastructure. Do not expose a production deployment
until staging, secrets, network, backup, monitoring, and independent-review gates
have been completed.

Citation auditing checks reference validity, lexical overlap, numbers, and common
negation patterns. It deliberately reports semantic entailment as **not evaluated**;
every claim requires human review. The offline retrieval benchmark is synthetic
and should be treated as a regression fixture, not a production-quality score.
